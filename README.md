# hello-compojure

 Compojure is a web application framework that works on top of Ring. Compojure does a lot of jobs necessary to create a web application. Using Compojure, we can focus more on creating web pages.

 ## How to start the Clojure program
 The first thing we do is create a Clojure project. BUT it’s not [lein new][] here. We will type in [lein new compojure][] instead.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
